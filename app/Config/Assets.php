     * string, either 'file' or 'version'.
     *
     * 'version' uses the Cache Busting Version setting below on production servers,
     * but uses the current timestamp for testing/development environments. This
     * has lower server load, but does require the version number to be updated
     * after every change.
     *
     * 'file' uses the modified time on the file. This ensures it is always up to
     * date and no chance for a developer to forget to update it. However, this
     * does increase server load as we're reading the value of the file on every
     * non-cached page load. This should probably only be used on small-medium
     * sites.
